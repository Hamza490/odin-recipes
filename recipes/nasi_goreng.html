    <h2>A Message From ME</h2>
        <P>Hello everyone! Nasi Goreng is one of my favourite dishes. It's my go-to during long coding sessions, movie nights, and when I'm feeling unwell. I hope you get to appreciate me learning HTML <strong>AND</strong> make this recipe for yourself.</P>

        <li>1 tsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp tamarind</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato puree</li>
        <li>2 tbsp <a href="http://geni.us/DarkSoySauce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dark soy sauce</a></li>
        <li>900 g <a href="https://www.kitchensanctuary.com/how-to-boil-rice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(2 lbs) cooked long grain rice</a> (for best results use rice that's been cooled and refrigerated)</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>5 spring onions (scallions) chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large wok or frying pan until hot.
            4 tbsp vegetable oil</p></li>
        <li><P>Dust the shallot or onion slices in cornflour and add to the wok. Cook, for 5-6 minutes until browned and crispy, then remove from the pan and place in a bowl.</P>
            <p>2 shallots or 1 small onion,2 tsp cornflour/cornstarch</p></li>
        <li><p>Turn the heat down to medium and add another 1 tbsp of oil to the wok and add in the shrimp paste, garlic, and chilli. Heat for one minute until fragrant, then add in the fish sauce, brown sugar, tamarind, tomato puree, and soy sauce and heat for a further minute.</p>
        
        <p>1 tsp shrimp paste,2 cloves garlic,1 red chilli,1 tsp fish sauce,1 heaped tbsp brown sugar,1 tsp tamarind,1 tbsp tomato puree,2 tbsp dark soy sauce</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Now add the rice to the wok and cook on a high heat. Use a spatula to ensure the rice doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan, and move the rice around so that it's all getting reheated.</p>
        <p>900 g (2 lbs) cooked long grain rice</p></li>
        <li><p>Once the rice is hot (this will take about 5 minutes), push the rice over to the side of the pan and crack one of the eggs into the space. Making sure this bit of the pan is over the heat, fry the egg, giving a mix with the spatula until the egg starts to cook and look scrambled.
        </p><p>5 eggs</p></li>
        <li><p>Now mix the egg into the rice. Add the spring onions, a pinch of salt and the crispy onions and mix it all together. Reduce the heat to low.
        </p><p>5 spring onions,1/2 tsp salt</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the remaining oil to a large frying pan and heat until hot, then fry the remaining four eggs until the white is crisp at the edges, but the yolk is still runny. You can baste the egg in the hot oil to make it cook quicker.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Divide the rice between four bowls and top each with a fried egg, then serve. I like to serve mine with some sweet chilli sauce too.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
